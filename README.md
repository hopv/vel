# Vel

Vel is a language for verified low-level software.

It dreams to be something like *Rust with logic*  
― a language that empowers people to build verified low-level software.

## Name

The name Vel stands for various concepts.

Vel is a language for *ve*rified *l*ow-level software.

Vel commits to the *vel*ocity of both development and runtime.

Vel wants to be smooth and relaxing like *vel*vet.

## Type system

Vel features a dependent ownership type system.

It enables reasoning about runtime objects using some propositions.  
Some propositions are copyable (like Rust's `Copy`), but others are not ― as we are in separation logic!

We can also use Rust-like borrows for sharing, very unlike traditional separation logic.

## Architecture

Vel's ecosystem is all written in Rust, for smooth development and great runtime performance.
